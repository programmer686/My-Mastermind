# My-Mastermind
To begin the game, simply execute "./my_mastermind" in your terminal.

Upon running the game, you will receive a prompt to input your guess.

'Well placed pieces' signifies that the number is not only present in the secret code but is also correctly positioned.

'Misplaced pieces' implies that the number is part of the secret code but is not in the correct position.

If you wish to specify the number of turns you'd like to have, you can do so by utilizing the '-t' flag, followed by the desired number of turns. 

For example: ./my_mastermind -t 3

In case you want to create your own secret code, you can utilize the '-c' flag. 

For example: ./my_mastermind -c 1234
